I give up...after spending 15+ hours on it and some hair pulling. 

I accidentally started off using React then switched to JS only after I had already spent ~5 hrs on it. 

After checking the syntax in Chrome Dev Tools' Console and online references, I still can't get the first and third snippets to work.
